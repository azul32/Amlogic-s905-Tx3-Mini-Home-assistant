# Tx3-Mini-Home-assistant-
Create Armbian Home assistant server Using Tv box. 
This is how i like to setup my amlogic tv box with limited cpu, ram and, storage
the only down side is no addons. 
for esphome complier i install esphome docker vm in another pc in my office connecting via zerotier.
then just add new dashboard pointing to esphome docker ip:port this is faster than directly using esphome in the tvbox.
the tx3-mini only consuming less than 3 watts.

#see release for files i use.

#it can be adapted for using in another s90x brand tv box
